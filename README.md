# GPU Temperature Monitoring and Fan Control

This project provides a Python-based solution for monitoring GPU temperature and controlling server fan speed using `ipmitool` commands. It leverages NVIDIA's NVML library for efficient GPU temperature monitoring.

## Features
- Monitors GPU temperature in real-time.
- Adjusts server fan speed based on GPU temperature thresholds.
- Uses `ipmitool` to control fan speed via IPMI commands.
- Lightweight and efficient, with minimal resource usage.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.9 or later**
2. **NVIDIA Drivers** installed on the server.
3. **ipmitool** installed on the server.
4. **pynvml** Python library for GPU monitoring.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd server-fan-control
```

### Install Dependencies
Ensure `pynvml` is installed:
```bash
pip install nvidia-ml-py3
```

### Docker Setup
Alternatively, you can use Docker to run the application:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Configuration
Update the following placeholders in the `fan_control.py` file or set them as environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:
- `SERVER_IP`: The IP address of the server.
- `IDRAC_USERNAME`: The username for IPMI access.
- `IDRAC_PASSWORD`: The password for IPMI access.

## Parameters Explained

### Configuration Parameters
- `SERVER_IP`: The IP address of the server where IPMI commands will be executed.
- `IDRAC_USERNAME`: The username for accessing the iDRAC interface of the server.
- `IDRAC_PASSWORD`: The password for accessing the iDRAC interface of the server.
- `CHECK_INTERVAL`: The time interval (in seconds) between each GPU temperature check and fan speed adjustment.

### Fan Speed Thresholds
- `TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH`: The GPU temperature (in 째C) above which the fan speed is set to 100%.
- `TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW`: The GPU temperature (in 째C) below which the fan speed is set to 20%.
- `FAN_SPEED_LOW`: The fan speed percentage (in hexadecimal) when the GPU temperature is below `TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW` (default: 20%).
- `FAN_SPEED_HIGH`: The fan speed percentage (in hexadecimal) when the GPU temperature exceeds `TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH` (default: 100%).

### GPU Monitoring
- The script uses NVIDIA's NVML library to monitor GPU temperatures.
- `nvmlDeviceGetCount()`: Retrieves the total number of GPUs available on the server.
- `nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(index)`: Gets the handle for a GPU at the specified index.
- `nvmlDeviceGetTemperature(handle, NVML_TEMPERATURE_GPU)`: Retrieves the temperature of the GPU associated with the given handle.

## How It Works
1. The script initializes NVIDIA's NVML library to monitor GPU temperature.
2. It enables manual fan control using `ipmitool`.
3. Based on the GPU temperature:
   - If the temperature exceeds `TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH` (default: 70째C), the fan speed is set to 100%.
   - If the temperature drops below `TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW` (default: 45째C), the fan speed is set to 20%.
   - Otherwise, the fan speed remains unchanged.

## Constraints
This Docker container only works on Dell PowerEdge servers that support IPMI commands, specifically:
- Dell PowerEdge R720
- iDRAC firmware version < 9 (e.g., firmware 3.30.30.30 or earlier)

## File Structure
- `fan_control.py`: The main Python script for monitoring and controlling fan speed.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for running the script in a container.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment.

## Usage
### Running Locally
1. Update the configuration in `fan_control.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 fan_control.py
   ```

### Running with Docker
1. Build and start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The script will automatically monitor GPU temperature and adjust fan speed as needed.

## Notes
- Ensure the server has IPMI enabled and accessible.
- The script assumes the first GPU (index 0) is being monitored. Update the code if multiple GPUs need to be monitored.
